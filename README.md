Cybersecurity-simulation
  Interactive, browser-based cybersecurity simulation to practice real-world defense skills—spot phishing, contain malware, harden passwords, and respond to incidents under time pressure. Built for students and     teams to learn by doing, not just reading.

# ✨ What’s inside
- **Scenario-based gameplay**: Phishing inbox triage, malware outbreak, weak-password audit, and basic SOC workflows.  
- **Quizzes + timers**: Timed rounds, streaks, and instant feedback to reinforce learning.  
- **Realistic artifacts**: Emails, logs, URLs, headers, and indicators of compromise (IOCs).  
- **Scoring & badges**: Accuracy, speed, and safe decisions unlock levels.  


# 🎯Learning objectives
- Identify phishing and social engineering cues  
- Evaluate password strength & MFA choices  
- Follow first-response steps for malware events  
- Practice safe browsing & link inspection  
- Build muscle memory for incident triage
